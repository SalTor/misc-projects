## About this project
I'm experimenting with the creation of discord bots

## Getting started
This setup relies on `discord.js` for interacting with the discord api(s). Follow along with their introduction [here](https://discordjs.guide/#before-you-begin)

Once you have that you'll want to create a `.env` file and fill it with the following keys and values
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`
  - This is from your discord app (in the developers portal)
  - Note: you only get to see this value once when you create your app, save it somewhere safe + private
- `CLIENT_ID`
  - This is also from your discord app
- `GUILD_ID`
  - This is the ID of the server you want your bot to have access to
