## Inspiration
I wanted to build a pokedex app and I came across Saepul Nahwan's designs on dribble: https://dribbble.com/shots/6540871-Pokedex-App

## Stuff I'm using
- https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2

## To do
- I want to create a radar chart for stats.. might use something like this: https://spyna.github.io/react-svg-radar-chart/
- Can I cache these requests I'm making during development?
- Each pokemon image isn't the same size, which results in awkward placement per pokemon profile, what to do?
- Need to think about designs / content for other pages and I don't think Saepul's designs account for much more than what I have right now
